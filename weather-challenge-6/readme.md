# Weather Forecast Dashboard

This program is a weather forecast dashboard that displays the current weather forecast and the next seven days forecast for a city. It also includes a "City History" section that displays cities that have been searched for previously.

## Features

- **Current Weather Forecast:** Displays the current weather information for a specific city.
- **Seven Day Forecast:** Displays the weather forecast for the next seven days for a specific city.
- **City History:** Keeps track of the cities that have been searched for and displays them in a list under the "City History" section.
- **Local Storage:** When a city is added to the "City History," it is appended to the local storage of cities. This ensures that the city list persists even after the page is refreshed.
- **Validation:** The submit button only accepts city names that truly exist.
